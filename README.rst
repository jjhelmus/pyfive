pyfive is an open source library for reading HDF5 files written using
pure Python (no C extensions). The package is still in development and not all
features of HDF5 files are supported. For a more mature Python library for
read and writing HDF5 files, try `h5py`_.

pyfive aims to support the same API as `h5py`_ for reading files. Cases where a
file uses a feature that is supported by `h5py`_ but not pyfive are considered
bug and should be reported on the `issue tracker`_. Writing HDF5 is not a goal
of pyfive and portions of the API which apply only to writing will not be
implemented.
